	abstract = {The problem of moving from one coadapted gene complex to a better one can be divided into two steps: first the advantageous combination has to appear and then it has to take over the population. Selection can have contrasting effects on the two stages. When selection is weak intermediate forms are frequent, and the advantageous combination appears easily. Spreading of that advantageous combination, on the other hand, tends to be hard, as recombination acts to break it. The opposite is true when selection is strong. Spreading is easier, but if selection is also strong against the intermediate forms, the appearance of the beneficial combination becomes an extremely rare event. This inherent contrast in the optimal conditions for the two stages raises the possibility that proximity of areas differing in the intensity of selection may significantly shorten the expected waiting time for a peak shift. We studied this phenomenon in a haploid two-locus diallelic model of two neighboring subpopulations. Our results show that limited migration between the two areas might shorten the waiting time for a peak shift by orders of magnitude in comparison with either complete isolation or complete mixing. Implications for peripheral evolution and speciation are discussed.},

@article{Gordo2005,
abstract = {Deleterious mutations are of extreme evolutionary importance because, even though they are eliminated by natural selection, their continuous pressure creates a pool of variability in natural populations. They are of potential relevance for the existence of several features in evolution, such as sexual reproduction, and pose a risk to small asexual populations. Despite their extreme importance, the deleterious mutation rate and the effects of each mutation on fitness are poorly known quantities. Here we analyze a simple model that can be applied to simple experiments, in microorganisms, aiming at the quantification of these values.},
