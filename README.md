## Figure reproduction

Figures were produced using Python with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, scikits-bootstrap, statsmodels, and mpltools packages. The code is available as an [IPython (Jupyter) notebook](https://github.com/yoavram/ruggedsim/blob/master/manuscript/supplementry.ipynb). The notebook includes the analytic approximations as Python functions and uses the simulation raw data which is necessary for Figures 2, 3, S1, S2, and F1.
