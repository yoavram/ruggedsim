This is the repository for the manuscript:

> Ram, Y. and Hadany, L. 2014. Stress-induced mutagenesis anc complex adaptation. Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 281: 20141025. DOI: [10.1098/rspb.2014.1025](http://prsb2014.yoavram.com) | [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3548) | [bioRxiv](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/007096)

### Data

The relevant simulated dataset is deposited on dryad:

> Ram Y., Hadany L. (2014) Data from: Stress-induced mutagenesis and complex adaptation. Dryad Digital Repository. DOI: [10.5061/dryad.3066j](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3066j).

## Figure reproduction

Figures were produced with Python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, scikits-bootstrap, statsmodels, and mpltools packages. The code is available as an [IPython (Jupyter) notebook](https://github.com/yoavram/ruggedsim/blob/master/manuscript/supplementry.ipynb). The notebook includes the analytic approximations as Python functions and uses the [simulated data](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3066j), which is necessary for Figures 2, 3, S1, S2, and F1.
